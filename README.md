# Letterbox_Messaging_App
An android messaging app was created using Kotlin where a user is able to send Text messages and images. An option for search was also provided. Firebase was used as a database. The user was notified of incoming new messages via Notifications, achieved through Firebase Cloud Messaging. Concepts of Recycler view and Picasso library were used in this project.
